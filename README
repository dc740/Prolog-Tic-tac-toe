Tic-tac-toe in SWI Prolog


Type "jugarTateti." to start.
make your play using "tic(squareNumber)."

The machine starts on the first game by default
You are X, the machine is O

The program does NOT know about every single possible play. But it does know the strategies needed to win or draw each match (you can't win, ever).
If you want to win at least one game you have to edit the program and change:
habilitar_gana_o_empata(2). 
to
habilitar_gana_o_empata(4). 

That little change will enable two weak strategies that will let you win a match if you are smart enough :)
